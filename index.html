        <h2>Research Projects</h2>
        <p> My research interests can be summarized by the following research question: “How can we make AI machines think and learn as humans?”</p>
        <p> My current research focus includes the following three areas: a) 'What' is AI agent's understanding of the user problem provided to them, b) 'How' do they solve the user problem based on their understanding of it, and c)'Why' do they provide a certain solution to a user problem as opposed to other solutions.</p>
        <p> My research goal is to enable AI machines access to its own metacognition model that it can use to explain themselves to humans. This will mark a first step in increasing the transparency and trustworthiness of AI agents because when an agent is able to explain its actions, the user will be able to trust it more.</p>
